Blender File
------------

Module to inspect a .blend file from Python.
Basic usage can be grasped from the test suit.

Import the module in your script and you are good to go:

   >>> import blendfile

This module supports both Python2.x and Python3.x at the moment.
Python 2.x support may be dropped in the future.

### Test Suit

To run the tests just do:

   >>> pip install pytest
   >>> py.test tests/
